Problem 127: abc-hits
============

The radical of n, rad(n) is the product of distinct prime factor of n.
For example, 504 = 2^3 x 3^2 x 7, so rad(504)=2 x 3 x 7=42

We shall define the triplet of positive integers (a,b,c) to be an abc-hit if:
1. gcd(a,b) = gcd(a,c) = gcd(b,c) = 1
2. a < b
3. a + b = c
4. rad(abc) < c

For example, (5, 27, 32) is an abc-hit because:
1. gcd(5, 27) = gcd(5, 32) = gcd(27, 32) = 1
2. 5 < 27
3. 5 + 27 = 32
4. rad(4320) = 30 < 32

It turns out that abc-hits are quite rare and there are only 31 abc-hits for
c < 1000, with sum(c/abc hits) = 12523

Find sum(c/abc hits) for c < 120000
